#DC-Cooling
This repository contains the code-base for the AI based datacenter cooling optimization solutions under development at Hewlett Packard Labs (HPE)

The repository will be actively updated over the next few years to expand the variety of data center cooling applications that can be enhanced by the use of AI and how they can be deployed for HPE data centers
